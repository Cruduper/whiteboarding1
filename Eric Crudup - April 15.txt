its 9:24 and i'm working on the first problem still because jsfiddle is not wanting to work. Might switch to a real VScode project to finish the rest of the problems?

its 10:31. I switched to the chrome console instead of jsfiddle and everything is working? Problem 1 done with 2 separate solutions. 

its 11:43. I'm about done with both 3 and 4, it's time for lunch. 

it's 1:17, after lunch. Finished all 5 problems.
